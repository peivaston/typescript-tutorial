In this repository I'm trying to use typescript to develop a finance logger. So you can have a controll of your finance, if you owe someone money or someone owes you, you can just log them in this format:
Type: Payment/Invoice
To / From:
Details: 
Amount(Â£):

And then you can press Enter.

It's not a fully functional project as of now, because I'm still learning TypeScript and trying to understand it.
